As I have no hands-on practice on react, the things understood by me I have implemented.
And the task was to design only the web site using a react template no backend was involved.
I wanted to make a bloging site but I didn't get the desired template so functionality of blogs was added and modified, here some fake data is used because of no backend to store data, images and respective data can be uploded in the blog section by the users who had logedin with their respective accounts.The respective files were added as shown below:

material-kit-react-main\src\main\src\pages\blog.jsx

material-kit-react-main\src\main\src\_mock\blog.js

material-kit-react-main\src\main\src\sections\blog\view
